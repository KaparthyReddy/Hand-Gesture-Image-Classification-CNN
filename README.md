## Hand-Gesture-Image-Classification-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for hand gesture image classification. It leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify and categorize static hand gestures from images. This repository serves as a foundation for building gesture-based applications such as sign language interpreters, touchless interfaces, and more.

## Data Sets
Two datasets were used from Kaggle:

Sign Language Digits: Provided as a NumPy array.

Sign Language MNIST: Contains alphabets A-Z, provided as a pandas DataFrame.

## Model
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of multiple convolutional, pooling, dropout, dense, and flatten layers. It processes images to predict the corresponding hand gesture class.

## Instructions to Run the Code
There are two main scripts:

FINALNUMHANDPRED for digits classification

ML Project V@ for alphabet classification

The corresponding datasets are included as folders. To run the code, download the datasets and update the file paths in the scripts to match your local folder locations.
