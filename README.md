## Data Sets.  
Two Datasets were taken from kaggle. One is Sign Language Digits, the other is Sign language MINST Representing alphabets from A to Z.  
The Digits Dataset was directly Given as a Numpy Array whereas the MINST Datset is in the form of a pandas Data Frame.  

## Model  
We used a Convulational Neural network to process and predict data from the images.  
It consinsts of multiple Convolutional, pooling, dropout densa flatten layers.  
  
## Instructions to run the Codes  
There are two files; FINALNUMHANDPRED and ML Project V@ for digits and alphabets repectively. The datasets for each of them  
have been uploaded as folders. In order to run the code one must download the datasets and change the file path name in the code to their respective loactions where the folders where stored.
